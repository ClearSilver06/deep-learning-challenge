ALPHABET SOUP REPORT

OVERVIEW
The purpose of this analysis is to look at several charities and determine whether or not 
they are successful. 

The dataframe this analysis uses contains information based on: Application Type, Classification, Use Case,
Organization type, Status, Income, Special Considerations, Ask Amount, and whether or not
they are successful.

The analysis will utilize tensorflow as well as a deep neural network and keras model. 

RESULTS

* The 'y' targeted variable is the column "IS_SUCCESSFUL". 
* The remaining columns were 'X'

Aside from the "EIN" and "NAME" columns, no other columns were dropped from the dataframe.

The model originally used two hidden layers each with 8 nodes and 100 epochs. The accuracy 
of those models were slightly lacking, around 74%. I made a few alterations and reduced the 
nodes, choosing 2 nodes per hiddne layer. The accuracy remain around the previous attempt.
I altered the number of epochs to 30 from the original 100 and it was this attempt that the
accuracy of the model increased to 78% which is a bit better than the previous others.

With just slight changes to the number of epochs and nodes the accuracy jumped. I believe
there is potential to raise the model's accuracy more if certain superfluous column datas 
were excluded from the training model.
